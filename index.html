<h3>About</h3>
<p> Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest follows the events of the first Pirates movie: Curse of the Black Pearl. 
  <br>

  The movie begins with a scene of William Turner and Elizabeth Swann, two main characters, preparing for their wedding. They are cut off by Lord Cutler Beckett, a main antagonist in the film. He orders for the arrest of both Will and Elizabeth for piracy, but offers a trade for their freedom. He desires a specific black compass that doesn't point North, which is held by Captain Jack Sparrow. Beckett orders Will to retrieve the compass in exchange for his and Elizabeth's freedom. William takes the offer and sets sail to find Jack Sparrow and take the compass. With Jack, a past debt arises with the other primary antagonist: Davy Jones. Davy Jones places "the black spot" on Jack, marking him for death because of his failure to meet his end of the debt. Jack and his crew flee to dry land, grounding their ship and pushing inward. Will finds them on this island, but they have all been imprisoned by a tribe local to the island. Jack and Will escape seperately, then meet again on Jack's ship. They go back to the water to escape the tribe, and a new idea strikes Jack. He tricks Will into boarding Davy Jones's ship to settle his debt. Jones gave Jack a new path to settle his debt: 100 souls in 3 days, to which he offers William Turner as the first soul. Will meets his father on Davy Jones's ship and makes a promise to return and set him free from Jones's inhumane emprisonment of his crew. Will gambles for his life, wins, and is allowed free from Jones's ship. Elizabeth threatens Cutler Beckett into signing the documentation for their freedom, including Jack Sparrow. She sets out to find and help William retrieve the compass. Jack seeks out Tia Dalma for a path to the heart of Davy Jones, which allows someone to kill Jones and become the captain of the Flying Dutchman if they stab the heart. She provides information for an exchange of an undead monkey, which Jack recieved in the first movie. Jack, Will, Elizabeth and a prior character, James Norrington, reunite and begin their search for Jones's heart. They fight with Jones and his crew, and they fight between each other. They end up finding the chest containing the heart and Jack hides the heart. Norrington finds the heart in the place Jack hid it and pockets it, disappearing from the group. The crew sets sail again, but Jones is not far behind. He calls upon the Kraken to take down Jack's ship, to which it ends up killing Jack. The Kraken sends Jack to the locker, and the rest of the crew have a new motive: free Jack from Jones's locker. At the end of the movie, they visit Tia Dalma again for a way to save Jack. This sets up the third movie.
